### A english poem

Light in the night,  
is my eye.  
It leads my bike,  
driving in the dark sky.  
  
I start to pray,  
because of the rain.  
Pray your coming,  
and pray our dating.  
  
Your birthday I forget,  
a situation I hate.  
A song and a pet,  
are out-of-date.  
  
A poem I write,  
is different.  
A present with the heart,  
is important.  
  
Busy as I be,  
Please forgive me.  
Once the time we see,  
Valentine's Day will everyday be!
